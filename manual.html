            <div class="content-area">
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Will food be provided at the hackathon?<br>
                    </b>
                    It’s going to be an intense weekend full of surprises, long nights and pivoting - but don’t worry we have you covered with lots of food and energy drinks throughout the weekend!
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Do I need an idea before the event?
                    </b><br>
                    It is not a requirement, and certainly not everyone at the event will pitch, but we do encourage you to pitch. We recommended doing some brainstorming before the event. You’ll be surrounded by extremely brilliant individuals, and we will have some awesome talks at the start of the event to inspire you and get the creativity flowing - if there is a chance for you to make your dream come true it's now!
                    <br>
                    <b>You don't want to be 10 years down the line thinking, "Ah, I should've pitch my idea at the HackTrain..." - do you?</b>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Does my idea have to be related to a specific domain? (i.e. trains?)
                    </b><br>
                    You can pitch any idea you have in your mind - it does not have to be of a specific domain to be taken into account. However, you will be in the perfect environment to analyze the problems related to rail transport system and what’s better, key stakeholders in charge of the UK rail network will be present ready to validate such ideas.
                    <br>
                    <b>The most important thing</b> is that you pitch disruptive, innovative ideas. Boring apps to gather all your starbucks coupons, are for normal hackathons - train hackathons deserve the most insane ideas!
                </p><br> 
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Can I work on something I've already been working on?
                    </b><br>
                    No. This would be very unfair for other TrainHackers - Ideas have to be fresh, at most, well researched. If the project has been started previously, even if it was during a hackathon a few weeks ago, it is not possible to re-use it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        How do the teams get assigned?
                    </b><br>
                    On the day everyone will have 60 seconds to pitch their idea. Then everyone will get a chance to vote for their favorite ideas and the teams will form around the top ideas. We will try and keep teams to 4 people for the event.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        What do I need to bring?
                    </b><br>
                    Obviously you need to take your laptop and a comfortable change of clothes for the weekend. On the Saturday night we will be staying in TechCube Edinburgh for the night so you will need to bring a sleeping bag if you want to get a decent night’s rest. 
                    <br>
                    Also it should go without saying but please bring deodorant and a toothbrush, otherwise the train rides might get a bit painful for everyone.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Do we have to arrange our own transport back from York?
                    </b><br>
                    If you are going to a destination other than London yes. If you are going to London, please read the initial paragraph regarding train travel.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        What happens after HackTrain?
                    </b><br>
                    We have put together a very strong and talented group of people for this hackathon and you will be left with an amazing new network of friends and plenty of opportunities. And if you build a great product that you want to take further we will definitely support you as much as we can! We will host a few meetups in the following months as well - we'll keep you updated!
                </p></br>

                  Can this idea make money? Is there positive customer growth or revenue? Is there a customer acquisition / rollout strategy? Has a revenue model been defined and is it realistic? Is the idea/team ready for capital and execution? Would you invest in this company at this point?

                  Did the team identify customers (demographic, location etc)? Did the team get out and talk to customers? What is the value proposition to customers? What channels of communication are used? Product/Market fit? Did they get a paying customer/sign a deal? Did they find a partner?

                <p>
                  Did the team identify their market? Does it have the potential to scale? Have they designed their idea with scalability in mind?

                <p>
                  Does the MVP express well their solution for the problem? Would people use it? Did they build their MVP with their customer in mind? Is it memorable? Does the project have appropriate graphics? Is it intuitive and easy to use? Do you

                    like 
                  </em>

                  Technical perspective:

                <p>
                  Does the project meet its goals? Can it be used by everyone? Does it work properly? Does it have enough working features? Are the features implemented the ones that define this project (implementing things that every single app/website/project out there has such as login is not considered useful in this context).

                  you about how awesome their project is? This is about rating the quality of the presentation in the perspective of an investor/expert. (The reason why this is only 10% is because the pitch will actually influence all the other points).

                  The <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/blpapi-http/blob/develop/doc/http-api-guide.md">Bloomberg HTTP API interface</a> was an HTTP interface developed to provide access to Bloomberg data during hackathons. The Bloomberg API has been used throughout <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/search?query=bloomberg">tenths of hackathons</a>. This API interface will allow all TrainHackers to access the <a title="API Libraries" href="http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/"> Bloomberg API</a> through HTTP and WebSockets.
                </p>
              </br>
                <p>
                In a nutshell, the Bloomberg API (BLPAPI) is a set of freely available    <a title="API Libraries" href="http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/libraries/">software development kits</a> (SDKs) that allow software developers to create applications that consume market data. With this API you will be able to receive <b>historical data</b> and <b> reference data</b>
                </p>
              </br>
              <p>
                You will be able to find all the documentation at the <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/blpapi-http/blob/develop/doc/http-api-guide.md">Bloomberg HTTP API page</a>. You can also check all the other projects listed under the <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg">Bloomberg Github.</a>

                <p>
                  This weekend, your fellow Bloomberg mentors, <a href="mailito:jmisiorny@bloomberg.net">Jakub Misiorny</a> and <a href="mailito:dpatulescu1@bloomberg.net">Radu Patulescu</a> will travel along with you to help you in any problems you face - so feel free to reach out to them throughout the journey!

                <br>
                <p>
                    Prior to the event, all TrainHackers will receive an email with the credentials required to be able to use the Bloomberg Financial API.

              <p>We are committed to becoming more transparent - so we&rsquo;re working to make relevant data and information more accessible to both rail users and other stakeholders.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the reasons we&rsquo;re so pleased to be involved in Hacktrain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>We have a number of operational data feeds available, but we&rsquo;d like your help in realising the value of the data.&nbsp; And we want&nbsp;to encourage the development of new products of interest to those who use the railway.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The feeds available randge include schedules, movement, train positioning, speed, etc. To use these feeds you&rsquo;ll need to create an account with us by visiting <a href="https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/ntrod/login">https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/ntrod/login</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <h1><a href="http://nrodwiki.rockshore.net/index.php/Darwin:Push_Port">ATOC's DARWIN</a></h1>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            The Darwin Push Port is an XML push feed that continuously streams information about the creation of, and changes to, train schedule records, together with train running predictions made by Darwin.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            You will be able to access a few extracts of DARWIN at the following <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e5ah5cnnv9wdr8e/AAChq0z7agKiwHVtAwV7qDjNa?dl=0">Dropbox link.</a> The file named “RTTIHistoryECV” is a 2 week extract from the East Coast route.  The other files are short, unfiltered 1 day extracts from the Darwin Push Port.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The Push Port can be filtered to a specific area of interest by TIPLOC, or to provide information for the entire country. Either way, the information delivered is complex and must be properly interpreted before presentation to end users.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The Push Port requires the user to build a database capable of capturing extremely high volumes of information, as well as a query engine to draw the information from your database. There is a large amount of interpretation work involved in this; however this allows substantial flexibility to apply the information to any product within the limitations of your own infrastructure.
