            <div class="content-area">
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Will food be provided at the hackathon?<br>
                    </b>
                    It’s going to be an intense weekend full of surprises, long nights and pivoting - but don’t worry we have you covered with lots of food and energy drinks throughout the weekend!
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Do I need an idea before the event?
                    </b><br>
                    It is not a requirement, and certainly not everyone at the event will pitch, but we do encourage you to pitch. We recommended doing some brainstorming before the event. You’ll be surrounded by extremely brilliant individuals, and we will have some awesome talks at the start of the event to inspire you and get the creativity flowing - if there is a chance for you to make your dream come true it's now!
                    <br>
                    <b>You don't want to be 10 years down the line thinking, "Ah, I should've pitch my idea at the HackTrain..." - do you? ;)
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Does my idea have to be related to a specific domain? (i.e. trains?)
                    </b><br>
                    You can pitch any idea you have in your mind - it does not have to be of a specific domain to be taken into account. However, you will be in the perfect environment to analyze the problems related to rail transport system and what’s better, key stakeholders in charge of the UK rail network will be present ready to validate such ideas.
                    <br>
                    <b>The most important thing</b> is that you pitch disruptive, innovative ideas. Boring apps to gather all your starbucks coupons, are for normal hackathons - train hackathons deserve the most insane ideas!
                </p><br> 
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Can I work on something I've already been working on?
                    </b><br>
                    No. This would be very unfair for other TrainHackers - Ideas have to be fresh, at most, well researched. If the project has been started previously, even if it was during a hackathon a few weeks ago, it is not possible to re-use it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        How do the teams get assigned?
                    </b><br>
                    On the day everyone will have 60 seconds to pitch their idea. Then everyone will get a chance to vote for their favorite ideas and the teams will form around the top ideas. We will try and keep teams to 4 people for the event.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        What do I need to bring?
                    </b><br>
                    Obviously you need to take your laptop and a comfortable change of clothes for the weekend. On the Saturday night we will be staying in TechCube Edinburgh for the night so you will need to bring a sleeping bag if you want to get a decent night’s rest. 
                    <br>
                    Also it should go without saying but please bring deodorant and a toothbrush, otherwise the train rides might get a bit painful for everyone.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Do we have to arrange our own transport back from York?
                    </b><br>
                    If you are going to a destination other than London yes. If you are going to London, please read the initial paragraph regarding train travel.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        What happens after HackTrain?
                    </b><br>
                    We have put together a very strong and talented group of people for this hackathon and you will be left with an amazing new network of friends and plenty of opportunities. And if you build a great product that you want to take further we will definitely support you as much as we can! We will host a few meetups in the following months as well - we'll keep you updated!

                <p>
                  Does the MVP express well their solution for the problem? Would people use it? Did they build their MVP with their customer in mind? Is it memorable? Does the project have appropriate graphics? Is it intuitive and easy to use? Do you

                  Does the project meet its goals? Can it be used by everyone? Does it work properly? Does it have enough working features? Are the features implemented the ones that define this project (implementing things that every single app/website/project out there has such as login is not considered useful in this context).

                  you about how awesome their project is? This is about rating the quality of the presentation in the perspective of an investor/expert. (The reason why this is only 10% is because the pitch will actually influence all the other points).
